# Logic_Gates--Eyad-Lokma-
This is the work of Eyad Mohamed &amp; Youssof Lokma on 24th of Nov 2021

## What is this branch?
This is my incomplete approach to the logic gates program.
### My approach
My approach is to allow the user to input the statement in a specific form, then I loop through each
item in the cie_list for each input in the statement in order to print a nicely formatted truth table.
But reality is harsh and I am overwhelmed with quizzes so this approach needs to be delayed :(

## How to run
. Git clone
. make sure to have installed a python version 3.6+
. then if on windows do `python statement.py`, and if you are a linux user you are far to supreme for me to tell you how to do so...

*_NB_*: main.py is not needed, I am just too lazy to delete
